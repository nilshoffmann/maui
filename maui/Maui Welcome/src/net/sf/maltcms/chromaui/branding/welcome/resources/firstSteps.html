        <h1>First Steps with Maui</h1>
        <p>After downloading and installing Maui for your operating system, there are 
            only a few additional post-installation steps necessary. After performing these all features 
            of Maui will be available for use. The statistical analysis methods in Maui use GNU R as their backend. Thus,
            you need to install a recent release of GNU R on your local computer or on a server machine within your local network that is accessible 
            from your local computer.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Install <a href="http://www.r-project.org">GNU R</a></li>
            <li>Start up R (preferrably a 64 bit session as Administrator</li>
            <li>At the command prompt, type <code>install.packages("Rserve")</code> and hit Enter</li>
            <li>Select a download mirror and install the package</li>
            <li>At the command prompt, type <code>library(Rserve); Rserve()</code> and hit Enter</li>
            <li>On Windows, a dialog may pop up asking you to allow Network connections for Rserve on your private network. You need to allow the default selected option.</li> 
            <li><a href="http://www.maltcms.de/maui/OptionsDialog/Advanced/RServe">Check your R and Rserve installation</a></li>
            <li>Close R</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.maltcms.de/maui/OptionsDialog/Advanced/RServe">Check your R and Rserve installation</a> again. Maui should start up a new local instance of Rserve.</li>
            <!--<li>Check your graphics card setup at <a href="http://www.maltcms.de/maui/Menu/Tools/net-java-nboglpack-glcapabilities-OpenGLCapabilitiesAction.instance">OpenGL Capabilities</a></li>-->
            <li>Install <a href="http://www.maltcms.de/maui/OptionsDialog/maltcmsOptions">Maltcms</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Should you encounter any problems during the installation, please <a href='http://maltcms.sourceforge.net/info/contact.html'>contact the authors</a> and report what you tried to do together with Maui's output (View->IDE Log).</p>
