COMMENT: 
Blast2x vs SP:
FUNCTION: Probably plays a structural role in chromatin. Involved in sister chromatid cohesion, possibly by interacting with the cohesin complex (By similarity).
SUBUNIT: Interacts directly with CBX5 via the PxVxL motif.
SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS: Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3; Name=1; Synonyms=A, IDN3-A; IsoId=Q6KC79-1; Sequence=Displayed; Name=2; Synonyms=B, IDN3-B; IsoId=Q6KC79-2; Sequence=VSP_011092, VSP_011093; Name=3; IsoId=Q6KC79-3; Sequence=VSP_011091; Note=No experimental confirmation available;
TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. Highly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, fetal and adult liver, fetal and adult kidney. Expressed at intermediated level in thymus, placenta, peripheral leukocyte and small intestine. Weakly or not expressed in brain, colon, spleen and lung.
DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: In embryos, it is expressed in developing limbs and later in cartilage primordia of the ulna and of various hand bones. Sites of craniofacial expression include the cartilage primordium of the basioccipital and basisphenoid skull bones and elsewhere in the head and face, including a region encompassing the mesenchyme adjacent to the cochlear canal. Also expressed in the spinal column, notochord and surface ectoderm sclerotome and what seem to be migrating myoblasts. Expressed in the developing heart in the atrial and ventricular myocardium and in the ventricular tubeculae but absent in the endocardial cushions. Also expressed in the developing esophagus, trachea and midgut loops, in the bronchi of the lung and in the tubules of the metanephros. Expression in organs and tissues not typically affected in CDL (e.g., the developing trachea, bronchi, esophagus, heart and kidney) may reflect a bias towards underreporting of more subtle aspects of the phenotype or problems that typically present later in life. Expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the cochlear canal possibly reflecting the hearing impairment commonly found. Weakly or not expressed in embryonic brain.
DOMAIN: Contains one Pro-Xaa-Val-Xaa-Leu (PxVxL) motif, which is required for interaction with chromoshadow domains. This motif requires additional residues -7, -6, +4 and +5 of the central Val which contact the chromoshadow domain.
PTM: Phosphorylated upon DNA damage, probably by ATM or ATR.
DISEASE: Defects in NIPBL are the cause of Cornelia de Lange syndrome type 1 (CDLS1) [MIM:122470]. CDLS is a clinically heterogeneous developmental disorder associated with malformations affecting multiple systems. CDLS is characterized by facial dysmorphisms, abnormal hands and feet, growth delay, cognitive retardation and various other malformations including gastroesophageal dysfunction and cardiac, ophthalmologic and genitourinary anomalies.
SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SCC2/Nipped-B family.
SIMILARITY: Contains 5 HEAT repeats.
