        <h1>First Steps with Maui</h1>
        <p>After downloading and installing Maui for your operating system, there are 
        only a few additional post-installation steps necessary. After performing these all features 
        of Maui will be available for use. The statistical analysis methods in Maui use GNU R as their backend. Thus,
        you need to install a recent release of GNU R on your local computer or on a server machine within your local network that is accessible 
        from your local computer.</p>
